            Here's a lovely picture of Dartmoor in Devon,England, where the
            ponies roam wild.On a sunny summer's day, it is a wonderful place to
            hike and enjoy the incredible views.When the mist and rain roll
            in,Darmoor can be a lonely and scary place where it's easy to lose
            your Way-it's where Sherlock Holmes met the Hound of the
            Baskervilles, Because this text is longer tham the Devon cottage is
            over to the left side as part of a new paragraph, which is exactly
            what we want to have happen.

            My sister lived in this delightful cottage by a stream in Devon
            until very recently-my daughter said she saw fairies in the garden
            one summer night.Because this text is short, the next image and text
            also move up next to the floated image of the cottage.

            The Queen of England prefers somewhere a little more spacious and
            secure. Windsor Castle is her favorite place to hang out with the
            family and her Corgi dogs.With the clearing element added,this text
            now clears(moves below) the previous floated elements and sits
            correctly alonside this image.
